##**CSS Grids:**

-CSS Grid is a layout system in CSS that allows you to create two-dimensional grids for arranging content on a web page.
*CSS Grid is different from other layout methods, like Flexbox and Floats, in that it allows you to define both columns and rows.
+You can create a grid container by setting the display property to "grid" on an element's CSS stylesheet.
-To define the rows and columns of your grid, you can use the grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns properties, respectively.
*You can also use grid-template-areas to define named grid areas, which can then be used to place items on the grid.
+Grid items can be placed on the grid using the grid-row and grid-column properties, or you can use shorthand properties like grid-area.
-CSS Grid also includes many other properties for controlling the sizing, alignment, and spacing of grid items, such as grid-gap and justify-items.

##**Flexbox:**

-Flexbox is a layout system in CSS that allows you to create one-dimensional layouts for arranging content on a web page.
*Flexbox is different from other layout methods, like Grid and Floats, in that it only deals with a single dimension at a time.
+You can create a flex container by setting the display property to "flex" on an element's CSS stylesheet.
-Flexbox items can be arranged along a main axis (either horizontally or vertically) using the justify-content property.
*You can also arrange items along a cross-axis (the opposite direction of the main axis) using the align-items property.
+Flexbox also includes many other properties for controlling the sizing, alignment, and spacing of flex items, such as flex-grow and flex-basis.
-Flexbox is commonly used for building responsive designs, as it allows items to be reflowed and reordered based on the available space.

## Counter using JavaScript

### JavaScript Logic

A counter is a simple numeric value that can be incremented or decremented.

In this JavaScript code:
+ We initialize the counter value (count) to 0.

* The updateCounter() function displays the current count in the console. You can modify this function to update a display element in your UI.

- The increment() function increases the counter value by 1 and then calls updateCounter() to display the updated count.

+ The decrement() function decreases the counter value by 1 if it's greater than 0, and then calls updateCounter().

* Finally, we call updateCounter() once to display the initial count.

Remember, you need to integrate these functions with your HTML and UI to see the counter in action. The example above demonstrates how to manipulate the counter using the provided functions.

That's it! You've created a basic counter using JavaScript. You can now integrate this functionality into your web project as needed.

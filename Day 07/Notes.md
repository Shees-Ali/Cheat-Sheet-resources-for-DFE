### Explanation:
- The function updateTime() is defined to get the current time using the Date object and format the hours, minutes, and seconds with two digits.

* The setInterval() function is used to call updateTime() every second (1000 milliseconds), updating the clock in real-time.

### Usage:
- Include the JavaScript code in your HTML file.

* Create elements with ids (hours, minutes, and seconds) to display the time in the browser.

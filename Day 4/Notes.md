## CSS Animations:

- CSS Animations allow you to add motion to elements on a web page using only CSS, without the need for JavaScript or other programming languages.

* CSS Animations are created by specifying keyframes, which define the starting and ending points of an animation, and then applying those keyframes to an element.

+ Keyframes are defined using the @keyframes rule in CSS, which specifies a name for the animation and the percentage of the animation duration at which each keyframe occurs.

- CSS Animations can be applied to many different properties of an element, including position, size, color, opacity, and more.

* Animations can be triggered by various events, such as hovering over an element, clicking a button, or loading the page.

+ Animations can be customized using various properties, such as the animation timing function, which determines how the animation progresses over time, and the animation duration, which sets the length of the animation.

- CSS Animations can also be combined with other CSS techniques, such as transitions and transforms, to create more complex and dynamic effects.

* CSS Animations are supported by most modern web browsers, but some older browsers may not support them or may require vendor prefixes.

+ When using CSS Animations, it's important to consider the performance impact of adding motion to a web page, as too many animations can slow down the page and make it difficult to use.

- It's also important to ensure that the animations enhance the user experience and don't distract or annoy users. Animations should be used judiciously and only when they add value to the design and functionality of the website.
